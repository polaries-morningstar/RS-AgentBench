skimage.filters.butterworth(image, cutoff_frequency_ratio=0.005, high_pass=True, order=2.0, channel_axis=None, *, squared_butterworth=True, npad=0)[source]#


Apply a Butterworth filter to enhance high or low frequency features.


This filter is defined in the Fourier domain.


Parameters:


image(M[, N[, …, P]][, C]) ndarray

Input image.


cutoff_frequency_ratiofloat, optional

Determines the position of the cut-off relative to the shape of the
FFT. Receives a value between [0, 0.5].


high_passbool, optional

Whether to perform a high pass filter. If False, a low pass filter is
performed.


orderfloat, optional

Order of the filter which affects the slope near the cut-off. Higher
order means steeper slope in frequency space.


channel_axisint, optional

If there is a channel dimension, provide the index here. If None
(default) then all axes are assumed to be spatial dimensions.


squared_butterworthbool, optional

When True, the square of a Butterworth filter is used. See notes below
for more details.


npadint, optional

Pad each edge of the image by 
npad pixels using 
numpy.pad's

mode='edge' extension.


Returns:


resultndarray

The Butterworth-filtered image.


Notes


A band-pass filter can be achieved by combining a high-pass and low-pass
filter. The user can increase 
npad if boundary artifacts are apparent.


The "Butterworth filter" used in image processing textbooks (e.g. [1],
[2]) is often the square of the traditional Butterworth filters as
described by [3], [4]. The squared version will be used here if

squared_butterworth is set to 
True. The lowpass, squared Butterworth
filter is given by the following expression for the lowpass case:


\[H_{low}(f) = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{f}{c f_s}\right)^{2n}}\]


with the highpass case given by


\[H_{hi}(f) = 1 - H_{low}(f)\]


where \(f=\sqrt{\sum_{d=0}^{\mathrm{ndim}} f_{d}^{2}}\) is the
absolute value of the spatial frequency, \(f_s\) is the sampling
frequency, \(c\) the 
cutoff_frequency_ratio, and \(n\) is the
filter 
order [1]. When 
squared_butterworth=False, the square root of
the above expressions are used instead.


Note that 
cutoff_frequency_ratio is defined in terms of the sampling
frequency, \(f_s\). The FFT spectrum covers the Nyquist range
(\([-f_s/2, f_s/2]\)) so 
cutoff_frequency_ratio should have a value
between 0 and 0.5. The frequency response (gain) at the cutoff is 0.5 when

squared_butterworth is true and \(1/\sqrt{2}\) when it is false.

skimage.filters.correlate_sparse(image, kernel, mode='reflect')[source]#


Compute valid cross-correlation of 
padded_array and 
kernel.


This function is fast when 
kernel is large with many zeros.


See 
scipy.ndimage.correlate for a description of cross-correlation.


Parameters:


imagendarray, dtype float, shape (M, N[, …], P)

The input array. If mode is 'valid', this array should already be
padded, as a margin of the same shape as kernel will be stripped
off.


kernelndarray, dtype float, shape (Q, R[, …], S)

The kernel to be correlated. Must have the same number of
dimensions as 
padded_array. For high performance, it should
be sparse (few nonzero entries).


mode{'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap', 'valid'}, optional

See 
scipy.ndimage.correlate for valid modes.
Additionally, mode 'valid' is accepted, in which case no padding is
applied and the result is the result for the smaller image for which
the kernel is entirely inside the original data.


Returns:


resultarray of float, shape (M, N[, …], P)

The result of cross-correlating 
image with 
kernel. If mode
'valid' is used, the resulting shape is (M-Q+1, N-R+1[, …], P-S+1).


skimage.filters.difference_of_gaussians(image, low_sigma, high_sigma=None, *, mode='nearest', cval=0, channel_axis=None, truncate=4.0)[source]#


Find features between 
low_sigma and 
high_sigma in size.


This function uses the Difference of Gaussians method for applying
band-pass filters to multi-dimensional arrays. The input array is
blurred with two Gaussian kernels of differing sigmas to produce two
intermediate, filtered images. The more-blurred image is then subtracted
from the less-blurred image. The final output image will therefore have
had high-frequency components attenuated by the smaller-sigma Gaussian, and
low frequency components will have been removed due to their presence in
the more-blurred intermediate.


Parameters:


imagendarray

Input array to filter.


low_sigmascalar or sequence of scalars

Standard deviation(s) for the Gaussian kernel with the smaller sigmas
across all axes. The standard deviations are given for each axis as a
sequence, or as a single number, in which case the single number is
used as the standard deviation value for all axes.


high_sigmascalar or sequence of scalars, optional (default is None)

Standard deviation(s) for the Gaussian kernel with the larger sigmas
across all axes. The standard deviations are given for each axis as a
sequence, or as a single number, in which case the single number is
used as the standard deviation value for all axes. If None is given
(default), sigmas for all axes are calculated as 1.6 * low_sigma.


mode{'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'}, optional

The 
mode parameter determines how the array borders are
handled, where 
cval is the value when mode is equal to
'constant'. Default is 'nearest'.


cvalscalar, optional

Value to fill past edges of input if 
mode is 'constant'. Default
is 0.0


channel_axisint or None, optional

If None, the image is assumed to be a grayscale (single channel) image.
Otherwise, this parameter indicates which axis of the array corresponds
to channels.


Added in version 0.19: 
channel_axis was added in 0.19.


truncatefloat, optional (default is 4.0)

Truncate the filter at this many standard deviations.


Returns:


filtered_imagendarray

the filtered array.

skimage.feature.blob_dog


Notes


This function will subtract an array filtered with a Gaussian kernel
with sigmas given by 
high_sigma from an array filtered with a
Gaussian kernel with sigmas provided by 
low_sigma. The values for

high_sigma must always be greater than or equal to the corresponding
values in 
low_sigma, or a 
ValueError will be raised.


When 
high_sigma is none, the values for 
high_sigma will be
calculated as 1.6x the corresponding values in 
low_sigma. This ratio
was originally proposed by Marr and Hildreth (1980) [1] and is commonly
used when approximating the inverted Laplacian of Gaussian, which is used
in edge and blob detection.


Input image is converted according to the conventions of 
img_as_float.


Except for sigma values, all parameters are used for both filters.

The input image.


maskarray of bool, optional

Clip the output image to this mask. (Values where mask=0 will be set
to 0.)


axisint or sequence of int, optional

Compute the edge filter along this axis. If not provided, the edge

                         for i in range(image.ndim)]) / image.ndim)


The magnitude is also computed if axis is a sequence.

outside the boundary of the image data.


Returns:


outputarray of float

The Farid edge map.

direction. Similar to the Scharr operator, this operator is designed with
a rotation invariance constraint.

Impulse response of the filter.  See LPIFilter2D.__init__.


filter_paramsdict, optional

Additional keyword parameters to the impulse_response function.


Other Parameters:


predefined_filterLPIFilter2D

If you need to apply the same filter multiple times over different
images, construct the LPIFilter2D and specify it here.


Examples


Gaussian filter without normalization:


>>> def filt_func(r, c, sigma=1):
...     return np.exp(-(r**2 + c**2)/(2 * sigma**2))
>>>
>>> from skimage import data
>>> filtered = filter_forward(data.coins(), filt_func)

Filter an image with the Frangi vesselness filter.


This filter can be used to detect continuous ridges, e.g. vessels,
wrinkles, rivers. It can be used to calculate the fraction of the
whole image containing such objects.


Defined only for 2-D and 3-D images. Calculates the eigenvalues of the
Hessian to compute the similarity of an image region to vessels, according
to the method described in [1].


Parameters:

skimage.filters.gabor(image, frequency, theta=0, bandwidth=1, sigma_x=None, sigma_y=None, n_stds=3, offset=0, mode='reflect', cval=0)[source]#


Return real and imaginary responses to Gabor filter.


The real and imaginary parts of the Gabor filter kernel are applied to the
image and the response is returned as a pair of arrays.


Gabor filter is a linear filter with a Gaussian kernel which is modulated
by a sinusoidal plane wave. Frequency and orientation representations of
the Gabor filter are similar to those of the human visual system.
Gabor filter banks are commonly used in computer vision and image
processing. They are especially suitable for edge detection and texture
classification.


Parameters:


image2-D array

Input image.


frequencyfloat

Spatial frequency of the harmonic function. Specified in pixels.


thetafloat, optional

Orientation in radians. If 0, the harmonic is in the x-direction.


bandwidthfloat, optional

The bandwidth captured by the filter. For fixed bandwidth, 
sigma_x
and 
sigma_y will decrease with increasing frequency. This value is
ignored if 
sigma_x and 
sigma_y are set by the user.


sigma_x, sigma_yfloat, optional

Standard deviation in x- and y-directions. These directions apply to
the kernel before rotation. If 
theta = pi/2, then the kernel is
rotated 90 degrees so that 
sigma_x controls the vertical
direction.


n_stdsscalar, optional

The linear size of the kernel is n_stds (3 by default) standard
deviations.


offsetfloat, optional

Phase offset of harmonic function in radians.


mode{'constant', 'nearest', 'reflect', 'mirror', 'wrap'}, optional

Mode used to convolve image with a kernel, passed to 
ndi.convolve


cvalscalar, optional

mode of convolution is
'constant'. The parameter is passed to 
ndi.convolve.


Returns:

Filtered images using the real and imaginary parts of the Gabor filter
kernel. Images are of the same dimensions as the input one.

channel_axis was added in 0.19.


outndarray, optional

If given, the filtered image will be stored in this array.


Added in version 0.23: 
out was added in 0.23.


Returns:


filtered_imagendarray

the filtered array


Notes


This function is a wrapper around 
scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter().


Integer arrays are converted to float.


out should be of floating-point data type since 
gaussian converts the
input 
image to float. If 
out is not provided, another array
will be allocated and returned as the result.


The multi-dimensional filter is implemented as a sequence of
one-dimensional convolution filters. The intermediate arrays are
stored in the same data type as the output. Therefore, for output
types with a limited precision, the results may be imprecise
because intermediate results may be stored with insufficient
precision.

                       for i in range(image.ndim)]) / image.ndim)


The magnitude is also computed if axis is a sequence.

Notes


The edge magnitude depends slightly on edge directions, since the
approximation of the gradient operator by the Prewitt operator is not
completely rotation invariant. For a better rotation invariance, the Scharr
operator should be used. The Sobel operator has a better rotation
invariance than the Prewitt operator, but a worse rotation invariance than
the Scharr operator.

skimage.filters.threshold_isodata(image=None, nbins=256, return_all=False, *, hist=None)[source]#


Return threshold value(s) based on ISODATA method.


Histogram-based threshold, known as Ridler-Calvard method or inter-means.
Threshold values returned satisfy the following equality:


threshold = (image[image <= threshold].mean() +
             image[image > threshold].mean()) / 2.0


That is, returned thresholds are intensities that separate the image into
two groups of pixels, where the threshold intensity is midway between the
mean intensities of these groups.


For integer images, the above equality holds to within one; for floating-
point images, the equality holds to within the histogram bin-width.


Either image or hist must be provided. In case hist is given, the actual
histogram of the image is ignored.


Parameters:


image(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Grayscale input image.


nbinsint, optional

Number of bins used to calculate histogram. This value is ignored for
integer arrays.


return_allbool, optional

If False (default), return only the lowest threshold that satisfies
the above equality. If True, return all valid thresholds.


histarray, or 2-tuple of arrays, optional

Histogram to determine the threshold from and a corresponding array
of bin center intensities. Alternatively, only the histogram can be
passed.


Returns:


thresholdfloat or int or array

Threshold value(s).

skimage.filters.threshold_li(image, *, tolerance=None, initial_guess=None, iter_callback=None)[source]#


Compute threshold value by Li's iterative Minimum Cross Entropy method.


Parameters:


image(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Grayscale input image.


tolerancefloat, optional

Finish the computation when the change in the threshold in an iteration
is less than this value. By default, this is half the smallest
difference between intensity values in 
image.


initial_guessfloat or Callable[[array[float]], float], optional

Li's iterative method uses gradient descent to find the optimal
threshold. If the image intensity histogram contains more than two
modes (peaks), the gradient descent could get stuck in a local optimum.
An initial guess for the iteration can help the algorithm find the
globally-optimal threshold. A float value defines a specific start
point, while a callable should take in an array of image intensities
and return a float value. Example valid callables include

numpy.mean (default), 
lambda arr: numpy.quantile(arr, 0.95),
or even 
skimage.filters.threshold_otsu().


iter_callbackCallable[[float], Any], optional

A function that will be called on the threshold at every iteration of
the algorithm.


Returns:


thresholdfloat

Upper threshold value. All pixels with an intensity higher than
this value are assumed to be foreground.

skimage.filters.threshold_local(image, block_size=3, method='gaussian', offset=0, mode='reflect', param=None, cval=0)[source]#


Compute a threshold mask image based on local pixel neighborhood.


Also known as adaptive or dynamic thresholding. The threshold value is
the weighted mean for the local neighborhood of a pixel subtracted by a
constant. Alternatively the threshold can be determined dynamically by a
given function, using the 'generic' method.


Parameters:


image(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Grayscale input image.


block_sizeint or sequence of int

Odd size of pixel neighborhood which is used to calculate the
threshold value (e.g. 3, 5, 7, …, 21, …).


method{'generic', 'gaussian', 'mean', 'median'}, optional

Method used to determine adaptive threshold for local neighborhood in
weighted mean image.


'generic': use custom function (see 
param parameter)


'gaussian': apply gaussian filter (see 
param parameter for custom                      sigma value)


'mean': apply arithmetic mean filter


'median': apply median rank filter


By default, the 'gaussian' method is used.


offsetfloat, optional

Constant subtracted from weighted mean of neighborhood to calculate
the local threshold value. Default offset is 0.


mode{'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap'}, optional

The mode parameter determines how the array borders are handled, where
cval is the value when mode is equal to 'constant'.
Default is 'reflect'.


param{int, function}, optional

Either specify sigma for 'gaussian' method or function object for
'generic' method. This functions takes the flat array of local
neighborhood as a single argument and returns the calculated
threshold for the centre pixel.


cvalfloat, optional

Value to fill past edges of input if mode is 'constant'.


Returns:


threshold(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Threshold image. All pixels in the input image higher than the
corresponding pixel in the threshold image are considered foreground.

Grayscale input image.


nbinsint, optional

Number of bins used to calculate histogram. This value is ignored for
integer arrays.


max_num_iterint, optional

Maximum number of iterations to smooth the histogram.


histarray, or 2-tuple of arrays, optional

Histogram to determine the threshold from and a corresponding array
of bin center intensities. Alternatively, only the histogram can be
passed.


Returns:


thresholdfloat

Upper threshold value. All pixels with an intensity higher than
this value are assumed to be foreground.

RuntimeError

If unable to find two local maxima in the histogram or if the
smoothing takes more than 1e4 iterations.

skimage.filters.threshold_multiotsu(image=None, classes=3, nbins=256, *, hist=None)[source]#


Generate 
classes-1 threshold values to divide gray levels in 
image,
following Otsu's method for multiple classes.


The threshold values are chosen to maximize the total sum of pairwise
variances between the thresholded graylevel classes. See Notes and [1]
for more details.


Either image or hist must be provided. If hist is provided, the actual
histogram of the image is ignored.


Parameters:


image(M, N[, …]) ndarray, optional

Grayscale input image.


classesint, optional

Number of classes to be thresholded, i.e. the number of resulting
regions.


nbinsint, optional

Number of bins used to calculate the histogram. This value is ignored
for integer arrays.


histarray, or 2-tuple of arrays, optional

Histogram from which to determine the threshold, and optionally a
corresponding array of bin center intensities. If no hist provided,
this function will compute it from the image (see notes).


Returns:


thresharray

Array containing the threshold values for the desired classes.


Raises:


ValueError

If 
image contains less grayscale value then the desired
number of classes.


Notes


This implementation relies on a Cython function whose complexity
is \(O\left(\frac{Ch^{C-1}}{(C-1)!}\right)\), where \(h\)
is the number of histogram bins and \(C\) is the number of
classes desired.


If no hist is given, this function will make use of

skimage.exposure.histogram, which behaves differently than

np.histogram. While both allowed, use the former for consistent
behaviour.


The input image must be grayscale.

skimage.filters.threshold_niblack(image, window_size=15, k=0.2)[source]#


Applies Niblack local threshold to an array.


A threshold T is calculated for every pixel in the image using the
following formula:


T = m(x,y) - k * s(x,y)


where m(x,y) and s(x,y) are the mean and standard deviation of
pixel (x,y) neighborhood defined by a rectangular window with size w
times w centered around the pixel. k is a configurable parameter
that weights the effect of standard deviation.


Parameters:


image(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Grayscale input image.


window_sizeint, or iterable of int, optional

Window size specified as a single odd integer (3, 5, 7, …),
or an iterable of length 
image.ndim containing only odd
integers (e.g. 
(1, 5, 5)).


kfloat, optional

Value of parameter k in threshold formula.


Returns:


threshold(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Threshold mask. All pixels with an intensity higher than
this value are assumed to be foreground.


Notes


This algorithm is originally designed for text recognition.


The Bradley threshold is a particular case of the Niblack
one, being equivalent to


>>> from skimage import data
>>> image = data.page()
>>> q = 1
>>> threshold_image = threshold_niblack(image, k=0) * q


for some value 
q. By default, Bradley and Roth use 
q=1.

skimage.filters.threshold_sauvola(image, window_size=15, k=0.2, r=None)[source]#


Applies Sauvola local threshold to an array. Sauvola is a
modification of Niblack technique.


In the original method a threshold T is calculated for every pixel
in the image using the following formula:


T = m(x,y) * (1 + k * ((s(x,y) / R) - 1))


where m(x,y) and s(x,y) are the mean and standard deviation of
pixel (x,y) neighborhood defined by a rectangular window with size w
times w centered around the pixel. k is a configurable parameter
that weights the effect of standard deviation.
R is the maximum standard deviation of a grayscale image.


Parameters:


image(M, N[, …]) ndarray

Grayscale input image.


window_sizeint, or iterable of int, optional

Window size specified as a single odd integer (3, 5, 7, …),
or an iterable of length 
image.ndim containing only odd
integers (e.g. 
(1, 5, 5)).


kfloat, optional

Value of the positive parameter k.


rfloat, optional

Value of R, the dynamic range of standard deviation.
If None, set to the half of the image dtype range.


Returns:


threshold(M, N[, …]) ndarray

skimage.filters.unsharp_mask(image, radius=1.0, amount=1.0, preserve_range=False, *, channel_axis=None)[source]#


Unsharp masking filter.


The sharp details are identified as the difference between the original
image and its blurred version. These details are then scaled, and added
back to the original image.


Parameters:


image(M[, …][, C]) ndarray

Input image.


radiusscalar or sequence of scalars, optional

If a scalar is given, then its value is used for all dimensions.
If sequence is given, then there must be exactly one radius
for each dimension except the last dimension for multichannel images.
Note that 0 radius means no blurring, and negative values are
not allowed.


amountscalar, optional

The details will be amplified with this factor. The factor could be 0
or negative. Typically, it is a small positive number, e.g. 1.0.


preserve_rangebool, optional

Whether to keep the original range of values. Otherwise, the input
image is converted according to the conventions of 
img_as_float.
Also see https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/user_guide/data_types.html


channel_axisint or None, optional

If None, the image is assumed to be a grayscale (single channel) image.
Otherwise, this parameter indicates which axis of the array corresponds
to channels.


Added in version 0.19: 
channel_axis was added in 0.19.


Returns:


output(M[, …][, C]) ndarray of float

Image with unsharp mask applied.


Notes


Unsharp masking is an image sharpening technique. It is a linear image
operation, and numerically stable, unlike deconvolution which is an
ill-posed problem. Because of this stability, it is often
preferred over deconvolution.


The main idea is as follows: sharp details are identified as the
difference between the original image and its blurred version.
These details are added back to the original image after a scaling step:


enhanced image = original + amount * (original - blurred)


When applying this filter to several color layers independently,
color bleeding may occur. More visually pleasing result can be
achieved by processing only the brightness/lightness/intensity
channel in a suitable color space such as HSV, HSL, YUV, or YCbCr.


Unsharp masking is described in most introductory digital image
processing books. This implementation is based on [1].

Parameters:

Input data.


Kfloat or (M, N) ndarray

Ratio between power spectrum of noise and undegraded
image.


impulse_responsecallable 
f(r, c, **filter_params)

Impulse response of the filter.  See LPIFilter2D.__init__.

If you need to apply the same filter multiple times over different

skimage.filters.window(window_type, shape, warp_kwargs=None)[source]#


Return an n-dimensional window of a given size and dimensionality.


Parameters:


window_typestring, float, or tuple

The type of window to be created. Any window type supported by

scipy.signal.get_window is allowed here. See notes below for a
current list, or the SciPy documentation for the version of SciPy
on your machine.


shapetuple of int or int

The shape of the window along each axis. If an integer is provided,
a 1D window is generated.


warp_kwargsdict

Keyword arguments passed to 
skimage.transform.warp (e.g.,

warp_kwargs={'order':3} to change interpolation method).


Returns:


nd_windowndarray

A window of the specified 
shape. 
dtype is 
np.float64.


Notes


This function is based on 
scipy.signal.get_window and thus can access
all of the window types available to that function
(e.g., 
"hann", 
"boxcar"). Note that certain window types require
parameters that have to be supplied with the window name as a tuple
(e.g., 
("tukey", 0.8)). If only a float is supplied, it is interpreted
as the beta parameter of the Kaiser window.


See https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.windows.get_window.html
for more details.


Note that this function generates a double precision array of the specified

shape and can thus generate very large arrays that consume a large
amount of available memory.


The approach taken here to create nD windows is to first calculate the
Euclidean distance from the center of the intended nD window to each
position in the array. That distance is used to sample, with
interpolation, from a 1D window returned from 
scipy.signal.get_window.
The method of interpolation can be changed with the 
order keyword
argument passed to 
skimage.transform.warp.


Some coordinates in the output window will be outside of the original
signal; these will be filled in with zeros.


Window types:
- boxcar
- triang
- blackman
- hamming
- hann
- bartlett
- flattop
- parzen
- bohman
- blackmanharris
- nuttall
- barthann
- kaiser (needs beta)
- gaussian (needs standard deviation)
- general_gaussian (needs power, width)
- slepian (needs width)
- dpss (needs normalized half-bandwidth)
- chebwin (needs attenuation)
- exponential (needs decay scale)
- tukey (needs taper fraction)
